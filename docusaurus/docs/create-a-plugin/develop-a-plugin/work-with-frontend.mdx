Develop the frontend component of a Grafana plugin in Typescript with ReactJS as the View library. Several commands are available within the `plugin` directory for interacting with the frontend.

:::warning
We [do not support](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/angular_deprecation/) plugins written in Angular.

## Frontend CLI reference

You can run the following commands when developing your plugin:

### <SyncCommand cmd="run dev" />

Builds the plugin in development mode and watches for changes to source code to rebuild the plugin.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run build" />

Builds the plugin for production. The output can be found in the `./dist` directory.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run test" />

Launches the test runner in watch mode.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run e2e" />

Launches the e2e test runner. Make sure to have an instance of Grafana running before you run e2e tests.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run lint" />

Runs the linter against source code to verify that you have adhered to the formatting and styling rules. This command will also report warnings for usage of deprecated code.

### <SyncCommand cmd="run lint:fix" />

Runs the linter in fix mode to automatically format the frontend code.
