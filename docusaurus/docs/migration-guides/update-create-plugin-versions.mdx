import UpdateNPM from '@snippets/createplugin-update.npm.md';
import UpdatePNPM from '@snippets/createplugin-update.pnpm.md';
import UpdateYarn from '@snippets/createplugin-update.yarn.md';

To update an existing plugin to use a newer version of the `create-plugin` tool, run the following command:


<CodeSnippets
  snippets={[
    { component: UpdateNPM, label: 'npm' },
    { component: UpdatePNPM, label: 'pnpm' },
    { component: UpdateYarn, label: 'yarn' },
  ]}
  groupId="package-manager"
  queryString="current-package-manager"
/>


This command reruns the original scaffolding commands against the configuration files, dependencies, and scripts. It automatically uses the latest version of the `create-plugin` tool. It prompts you to confirm any destructive operations before it runs.

:::tip
We recommended that you normally agree to all prompts so that configs, dependencies, and scripts are kept in sync.

## Prompts

When you run the `update` command, you are prompted with the following questions. The default for each prompt is `No`.

### Would you like to update the project's configuration?

Select `y` to replace the files inside the `.config` directory. By doing so, you can make sure that the plugin is built and tested with the latest Grafana recommended configurations.

### Would you like to update the following dependencies in the `package.json`?

Select from the following choices:

- **`Yes, all of them`:** This updates all existing dependencies and adds any missing dependencies to `package.json`.
- **`Yes, but only the outdated ones`:** This updates all existing dependencies in `package.json`.
- **`No`:** This choice skips this step, thus preventing any dependency updates.

Note that if there are no dependencies then you will not see this prompt.

### Would you like to update the scripts in your `package.json`? All scripts using grafana-toolkit will be replaced.

Select 'y' to update any npm scripts in the `package.json` file to match the latest configurations. Any scripts that previously used `grafana-toolkit` are replaced.

:::warning
We strongly recommend that you consult the [changelog](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-tools/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes before making changes to your configuration.
